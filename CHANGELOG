### CHANGELOG

v2.1.0 (Earth)

- R deSolve package can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.


v2.0.0 (Venus)

- improved threshold levels for Sampled PLE plots.
- added 20 tests including wrong configuration file settings.
- extensive refactory of unit tests.
- source code uses PEP8 standard
- source code cleaning and reformatting.
- improved source code by eliminating some warning highlighted by PyCharm.
- moved script core functions within sbpipe package.
- the copasi package is now a dynamically loaded simulator. Users can choose the simulator
to use in the configuration file.
- simulators are loaded dynamically. Uncoupling between simulators and pipelines.
- separation of code for generating data from pipeline package. 
- improved source code modularisation for the whole program.
- extracted scripts (run_sbpipe and cleanup_sbpipe) from sbpipe/.
- sbpipe supports execution as a Python module (__main__.py).
- all Python imports are now absolute (in agreement with Python 3). 
- improvements to program prints
- project renamed sbpipe
- added AIC, AICc, BIC to the parameter estimation summary table.
- randomisation of initial parameter values for parameter estimation is now only
performed by Copasi.
- added plots comparing model simulation vs experimental data in simulate pipeline.
- improving plot margins for simulate and single parameter scan pipelines.
- source code refractoring in parameter estimation analysis task.
- fixed a bug in parameter estimation pipeline related to the filtering of confidence
intervals from the complete data set.
- added ratios in parameter estimation summaries to investigate the distance between the
estimated parameter and its confidence intervals.
- plot polishing.
- separated options for plotting 2d correlations within 66%, 95%, or 99% confidence intervals.
- added 99% confidence intervals parameter estimation plots. 
- added option to plot parameter estimation plots using the scientific notation.
- improved plots layout (fonts, legends).
- added option for y axis label to simulate and single parameter scan pipelines.
- Copasi models are fully consistent.
- table of estimated parameter and confidence values is in normal scale (not log10). 


v1.0.0 (Mercury)

- completed source code documentation
- completed user and developer manuals.
- configured Python Sphinx for documenting SB pipe
- bug fixes.
- separation of pdf report code from pipelines.
- configuration sessions integrated in pipeline classes.
- pipelines converted to classes.

- use of sections in configuration
- separation of configuration file parsing from program logic.
- restructuring dataset parsing for simulate and single_param_scan.
- added parameter scan plot with homogeneous lines (useful for plotting param conf. interv.).
- replaced all prints with Python logging. 
- improved LaTeX reports
- tested parameter estimation using Gillespie algorithm for model simulation.

- internalised code for each pipeline; run_sbpipe.py is the main executor for sbpipe.
- bug fixes.
- models can now be simulated in parallel using PP, SGE, or LSF.
- separation of parallel code from param_estim__copasi pipeline. It is generic now.
- sbpipe should now be platform independent (untested yet).
- removed unused dependencies.
- better separation of test cases.
- pipeline steps can be executed separately.
- pipeline restructuring (separation of the steps: generate data, analyse data, and generate report).
- model parameters can now be estimated in parallel using PP, SGE, or LSF.
