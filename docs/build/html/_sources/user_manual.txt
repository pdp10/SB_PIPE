Introduction
------------

This package contains a collection of pipelines for dynamic modelling of
biological systems. It aims to automate common processes and speed up
productivity for tasks such as model simulation, single/double parameter
scan, and parameter estimation.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use SB pipe, the following software must be installed:

-  Python 2.7+ - https://www.python.org/
-  R 3.2.3+ - https://cran.r-project.org/

SB pipe can work with the following simulators (at least one must be
installed):

-  Copasi 4.16+ - http://copasi.org/ (for model simulation, parameter
   scan, and parameter estimation)
-  R deSolve 1.14+ (for model simulation)

If LaTeX/PDF reports are also desired, the following software must also
be installed:

-  LaTeX 2013

Depending on your operating system, LaTeX can be downloaded at these
websites:

-  GNU/Linux: https://latex-project.org/ftp.html
-  Windows: https://miktex.org/

GNU/Linux
^^^^^^^^^

It is advised that users install Python, R and (optionally) LaTeX
packages using the package manager of their GNU/Linux distribution.
Users need to make sure that the packages ``python-pip`` and
``texlive-latex-base`` (only for reports). In most cases, the
installation via the package manager will automatically configure the
correct environment variables.

If a local installation of Python, R, or LaTeX is needed, users need to
add the following environment variables to ``$PATH`` in their
``$HOME``/.bashrc file as follows:

::

    # Path to R
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/R/binaries/

    # Path to Python. Scripts is the folder (if any) containing the Python 
    # script `pip`. pip must be available via command line.
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/Python/:/path/to/Python/Scripts/

    # Path to LaTeX
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/LaTeX/binaries/

The correct installation of Python, R, and LaTeX can be tested by
running the commands:

::

    # If variables were manually exported, reload the .bashrc file
    $ source $HOME/.bashrc

    $ python -V
    Python 2.7.12
    $ pip -V
    pip 8.1.2 from /home/ariel/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)

    $ R --version
    R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10) -- "Wooden Christmas-Tree"
    Copyright (C) 2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

    $ pdflatex -v
    pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/Debian)
    kpathsea version 6.2.1
    Copyright 2015 Peter Breitenlohner (eTeX)/Han The Thanh (pdfTeX).

As of 2016, Copasi is not available as a package in GNU/Linux
distributions. Users must add the path to Copasi binary files manually
editing their GNU/Linux ``$HOME``/.bashrc file as follows:

::

    # Path to CopasiSE
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/CopasiSE/

The correct installation of CopasiSE can be tested by running the
command:

::

    # Reload the .bashrc file
    $ source $HOME/.bashrc

    $ CopasiSE -h
    COPASI 4.16 (Build 104)

At this stage, Python, R, Copasi, and (optionally) LaTeX should be
installed correctly. SB pipe requires the configuration of the
environment variable ``$SBPIPE`` which must also be added in the
``$HOME``/.bashrc file. The package also needs to be added to ``$PATH``.
To do so, users need to add the following lines to their
``$HOME``/.bashrc file:

::

    # SBPIPE
    export SBPIPE=/path/to/sbpipe
    export PATH=$PATH:$SBPIPE/scripts

Now you should reload the .bashrc file to make the previous change
effective:

::

    # Reload the .bashrc file
    $ source $HOME/.bashrc

Before testing the correct installation of SB pipe, users need to
install Python and R dependency packages used by SB pipe. Two scripts
are provided to perform these tasks automatically.

To install SB pipe Python dependencies on GNU/Linux, run:

::

    $ cd $SBPIPE/
    $ ./install_pydeps.py

To install SB pipe R dependencies on GNU/Linux, run:

::

    $ cd $SBPIPE/
    $ R
    # Inside R environment, answer 'y' to install packages locally
    > source('install_rdeps.r')

If R package dependencies must be compiled, it is worth checking that
the following additional packages are installed in your machine:
``build-essential``, ``liblapack-dev``, ``libblas-dev``,
``libcairo-dev``, ``libssl-dev``, ``libcurl4-openssl-dev``, and
``gfortran``. After installing these packages, ``install_rdeps.r`` must
be executed again.

The correct installation of SB pipe can be tested by running the
command:

::

    $ run_sbpipe.py -v
    2.1.0

Windows
^^^^^^^

Windows users are also strongly advised to install the package:

-  Cygwin 2.6.0 https://www.cygwin.com/

Cygwin offers a GNU/Linux-like shell. This makes the installation of
dependencies easier as this follows the configuration for GNU/Linux
users.

Windows users may need to edit the ``PATH`` environment variable so that
the binary files for the previous packages (Copasi, Python, R, and
(optionally) LaTeX) are correctly found. Specifically for Python, the
python scripts ``pip.py`` and ``easy_install.py`` are located inside the
folder ``Scripts`` within the Python root directory. The path to this
folder must also be added to ``PATH``.

Therefore, the following environment variables must also be added:

::

    SBPIPE=\path\to\sbpipe
    PATH=[previous paths];%SBPIPE%\scripts

**NOTE for Cygwin:** Environment variables can also be configured
directly within the .bashrc file in cygwin/home/USERNAME/. In the
beginning of this file, users should place:

::

    # Path to R
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/R/binaries/

    # Path to Python
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/Python/:/path/to/Python/Scripts/

    # Path to LaTeX
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/LaTeX/binaries/

    # Path to CopasiSE
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/CopasiSE/binaries/

    # SBPIPE
    export SBPIPE=/path/to/sbpipe
    export PATH=$PATH:$SBPIPE/scripts

After configuring the environment variables directly or internally in
Cygwin, the next step is to install Python and R packages used by SB
pipe. Two scripts are provided to perform these tasks automatically.

To install SB pipe Python dependencies using Cygwin on Windows, run:

::

    $ cd /cygdrive/PATH/TO/SBPIPE/
    $ python.exe install_pydeps.py

To install SB pipe R dependencies using Cygwin on Windows, run:

::

    $ cd /cygdrive/PATH/TO/SBPIPE/
    $ R.exe
    # Inside R environment, answer 'y' to install packages locally
    > source('install_rdeps.r')

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If desired, SB pipe can be installed in your system. To do so, run the
command inside the sbpipe folder:

::

    $ cd $SBPIPE
    $ python setup.py install

The correct installation of SB pipe and its dependencies can be checked
by running the following commands inside the SB pipe folder:

::

    $ cd $SBPIPE/tests
    $ ./test_suite.py

How to use SB pipe
------------------

Preliminary configuration steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pipelines using Copasi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before using these pipelines, a Copasi model must be configured as
follow using CopasiUI:

**pipeline: simulation**

-  Tick the flag *executable* in the Time Course Task.
-  Select a report template for the Time Course Task.
-  Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model
   but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.

**pipelines: single or double parameter scan**

-  Tick the flag *executable* in the Parameter Scan Task.
-  Select a report template for the Parameter Scan Task.
-  Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model
   but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.

**pipeline: parameter estimation**

-  Tick the flag *executable* in the Parameter Estimation Task.
-  Select the report template for the Parameter Estimation Task.
-  Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model
   but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.

Pipelines using R deSolve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**pipeline: simulation**

The model output must be saved to a file. This file must be the model
name with csv or txt extension. Fields must be separated by TAB, and row
names must be discarded:

-  write.table(out, file="simple\_lotka\_volterra.csv",
   sep=":raw-latex:`\t`", row.names=FALSE) .

Running SB pipe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SB pipe is executed via the command *run\_sbpipe.py*. The syntax for
this command and its complete list of options can be retrieved by
running *run\_sbpipe.py -h*.

As of Sep 2016 the output is as follows:

::

    $ run_sbpipe.py -h
    Usage: run_sbpipe.py [OPTION] [FILE]
    Pipelines for systems modelling of biological networks.

    List of mandatory options:
            -h, --help

            -c, --create-project
                    Create a project structure using the argument as name.
            -s, --simulate
                    Simulate a model.
            -p, --single-param-scan

            -v, --version
                    Shows the version.                
    Exit status:
     0  if OK,
     1  if minor problems (e.g., a pipeline did not execute correctly),
     2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

    For complete documentation, see README.md .

The first step is to create a new project. This can be done with the
command:

::

    $ run_sbpipe.py --create-project project_name

This generates the following structure:

::

    project_name/
        | - Data/
        | - Models/
        | - Working_Folder/

Models must be stored in the Models/ folder. The folder Data/ is meant
for collecting experimental data files and analyses in one place.
Regarding Copasi, once the data files (e.g. for parameter estimation)
are generated, **it is advised** to move them into the Models/ folder so
that the Copasi (.cps) file and its associated experimental data files
are stored in the same folder. To run SB pipe, users need to create a
configuration file for each pipeline they intend to run (see next
section). These configuration files should be placed in the
Working\_Folder/. This folder will eventually contain all the results
generated by SB pipe.

For instance, the pipeline for parameter estimation configured with a
certain configuration file can be executed by typing:

::

    $ run_sbpipe.py -e my_config_file.conf

Pipeline configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pipelines are configured using files (here called configuration files).
These files are INI files and are therefore structured as follows:

::

    [pipeline_name]
    option1=value1
    option2=value2
    ...

In SB pipe each pipeline executes three tasks: data generation, data
analysis, and report generation. Each task depends on the previous one.
This choice allows users to analyse the same data without having to
generate it every time, or to skip the report generation if not wanted.
Assuming that the configuration files are placed in the Working\_Folder
of a certain project, examples are given as follow:

**Example 1:** configuration file for the pipeline *simulation*
